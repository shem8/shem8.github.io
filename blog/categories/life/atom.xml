    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At the first day in <a href="http://www.myroll.com/about">MyRoll</a> I was exiting- it was my first day in a startup, I was the first employee in the company and we all were thrilled to get started the new adventure.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>[caption id=&ldquo;attachment_630&rdquo; align=&ldquo;alignright&rdquo; width=&ldquo;357&rdquo;]<img src="https://shem8.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/291404_493445824002481_472952276_o.jpg?w=559" alt="291404_493445824002481_472952276_o" /> Me and my new best friend.[/caption]</p>

<p>But you know you don&rsquo;t really on board until you get your new MacBook Pro.</p>

<p>In the past 3 years I&rsquo;m pretty sure I&rsquo;ve been seeing my Mac more than my wife. It was there when we hacked all night, on conferences and talks I gave and more.</p>

<p>A few months ago, the startup I was working for <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2015/11/12/avg-acquires-israeli-photo-management-startup-myroll-plans-to-integrate-the-technologies/">got acquired</a> and I began my corporate life, as part of the move we left our old Macs behind and got the new super fast PCs. I&rsquo;m really far from being a Windows fan, and I really liked the concept of working wherever you want, so I immediately raised my voice about this (some are getting laptops, but the default is PC).</p>

<p>I was told that I can get a laptop, but they asked me one single question- &ldquo;Why? Why do you really <strong>need </strong>a laptop?&rdquo;. I didn't actually had an answer, this is just the way it is, developers are working on Mac, this is how it goes, just go to the next DroidCon close to you home and look at the audience.</p>

<p>The only reason I had is that I might want working from home and their answer was &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want you to work from home- we want you to be with your family when you&rsquo;re home, leave work at work&rdquo;, they were right, my work-life balance is much better since I got here.</p>

<p>So do I really need a Mac? Is it possible that this is just a useless trend that everyone following seamlessly? I thought about that in the following 3 months since I got here and came up with few points points:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Hands down the most important thing here (in my opinion) is the ability to easily go and seat with your college- if it&rsquo;s for one helping each other with bug in code, or easy integration for your APIs or even show a demo for your designers. Because this is a big company and you probably working with people that are in a different room (or floor), it is sometimes reduce the feedback loop dramatic and solve a lot miscommunication.</p></li>
<li><p>Work remotely- or at least give the option for people sometimes work from remote, read the <a href="https://blog.stackoverflow.com/2013/02/why-we-still-believe-in-working-remotely/">great post from stack overflow team</a> on why they believe its so good, in short- it helps to increase productivity, and more hiring options.</p></li>
<li><p>You need to encourage your employees to go out there and participate in conferences, if as a member for leaning new things, or even better- show and talk about their work as a speaker. You also want it to be as easier as possible, if someone talk about new library- it&rsquo;s better try it on the project right now. If it some cool tool he or she developed- you want to show it easily, without setup it in a new computer.</p></li>
<li><p>Hackatons are great, I really enjoy the sense of responsibility of deliver a product in 24 hours, even if it&rsquo;s just an app that block your smartphone outgoing communication when  you&rsquo;re drunk (I&rsquo;ll call it &ldquo;XGuard&rdquo;). Bringing a PC to an hackaton will just waste you an hour for setup and will make you look as noob.</p></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><p>Healthier and refreshing work environment- sitting next to a desk is <a href="http://www.diygenius.com/your-desk-job-is-killing-you-the-truth-about-sitting-down-infographic/">killing you</a>, go and stand in front of the window, see the amazing world outside, go work in the sun and refresh your head.</p></li>
<li><p>As a boss, you want you workers will be familiar with the bleeding edge technologies out there, that kind of people usually will be the ones that will drive your team for a better and newer tools, so why not encourage them and give them a laptop so they will be able to learn <a href="https://shem8.wordpress.com/2016/01/01/kotlin-a-better-java-for-android/">Kotlin </a>in the late night?</p></li>
</ul>


<p>So that it, I now about to share this post with our VP of R&amp;D and hope for good =)</p>

<hr />

<p>Disclaimers:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>In a lot of places there isn&rsquo;t really a problem to get a laptop, but the problem is the default- because 90% of the people will go with the default.</p></li>
<li><p>When referring to Mac I intend to unix based operation system laptop, because I think that developers should be familiar with terminal and shell scripting for couple of reason (that&rsquo;s for another post). I just think that Mac is best out there&hellip;</p></li>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Over the past 3 years I&rsquo;ve been working at </em><a href="http://myroll.com/"><em>MyRoll</em></a><em> (previously called Flayvr, the startup that loves you photos as much as you do</em>)._ I joined right after the seed stage and I was the first employee of the company. This was my first time working at a startup and it&rsquo;s hands-down one of the best experiences I&rsquo;ve had in my not-so-long life. Lately, more and more of my friends have asked me: &ldquo;Should I join a startup, or just go corporate - something that&rsquo;s financially stable?&rdquo;. __</p>

<!--more-->


<p><em><em>First- I want to clear the water and say that I don&rsquo;t really have an answer for that.  It really depends on the type of person you are. However, these is my 2 cents about all the </em>**</em>GOOD<em>**</em> of working in a small startup (Don&rsquo;t worry, there&rsquo;s plenty of bad as well - coming soon):_</p>

<h2>1. You learn fast (because you don&rsquo;t have a choice)</h2>

<p>On my very first day at MyRoll I was given the task of writing a feature in our iOS app. It was my first time writing code for Mobile, first time working on objectiveC, first time working on a Mac, first time working with git, AND first time reading our code. There was no one-month boot camp, no onboarding powerpoints, no tutorials, and ZERO team members to pair program or review my code. Just the internet and the CTO that wrote the MVP for demo. A week later I had to add some app analytics to write to the DB so I had, in turn, to learn rails (from zero). A year later I was the one that started developing our Android app.</p>

<p>Jumping on the horse and learning how to ride, time after time, over and over again, each time with a different type of horse (or ride? I lost myself in the analogy), makes you develop a real capability for learning new things (no matter what they are). You learn to predict the pitfalls, you know where things are going be more tricky and you develop some sense about what’s right and wrong in what you&rsquo;re doing.</p>

<h2>2. You go for the impossible, because the possible things are already there</h2>

<p>Before we started working on Flayvr, people treated photos as isolated items. Our first goal was therefore  to find the context of the user&rsquo;s media and create a full meaningful story from it. So we took Ron’s, our CEO, endless photos stream and started to analyze it (I know this guy for 3 years but through his photos I also know how his trip to Barcelona in 2005 was&hellip;). We analyzed it manually and understood how 2 photos are connected to the same scene or event, we went over on different end cases and built some pretty solid algorithms to cluster his photos and videos.</p>

<p>Than we asked some friends to test our algorithm on their stream. It was pretty bad&hellip; Ron had 2 kids and he literally records every second in their life - my friends, on the other hand, are party people that have tons of Whatsapp photos that are unrelated to one another. It looked like every person has his own unique stream, and it felt too complicated for a computer to just magically understand it.</p>

<p>Back to the drawing board - we categorized our main users. We understood that we have different kinds of people and they are all different, but that we can easily adapt our algorithm to each one: Android or iPhone users? Are they taking a lot of photos or just getting sent 4-5 photos in Whatsapp? is she a professional photographer or a 13 years old selfie taker? etc..</p>

<p>We then tweaked our algorithm (and are still making it better and better, there is no magic solution here) and actually arrived at some pretty solid results.</p>

<p><strong>Why? Because he had no alternatives </strong>- it was either about delivering a good damn product or giving back our investors their money.</p>

<h2>3. You break things. A lot!</h2>

<p>When moving fast you sometimes fall, just like a new baby born child. In the beginning you are going to  fall a lot, but slowly you learn how to put one leg in front of the other, you learn to keep your balance and in the end you are running smoothly.</p>

<p>[caption id=&ldquo;&rdquo; align=&ldquo;alignright&rdquo; width=&ldquo;352&rdquo;]<img src="http://c2.thejournal.ie/media/2013/04/falling-off-catwalk.gif" alt="" /> Pushing to production on 1AM on Friday.[/caption]</p>

<p>At first, releasing a new version was a big deal. We had a release doc with a couple of stages that you had to be checked: making sure you&rsquo;re working with the production env, testing it on a couple of devices, checking for updates and fresh install, etc&hellip; That took some time, and as we gained confidence the release cycle got shorter and we started  pushing a new version to our users 2-3 times a week (and sometimes even more).</p>

<p>But even the adults fall sometimes, and we did have some bad deploys. Shit happens, you must accept that. If Facebook is uploads a new version of the app that crashes for 10% of the users right on start,  the result will be a twitter storm. Or if <a href="http://mashable.com/2015/07/01/google-photos-black-people-gorillas/">google computer vision miserably fails </a>- you will see it all over the net. But in our case we realized we have the time to fix, and users are more tolerant towards our mistake.</p>

<h2>4. You aren’t afraid from failures</h2>

<p>Further to my last point - because of the uncertainty and the risk- taking nature of startups, you will fail often. From time to time, you learn to live with all those failures and instead of being upset after each one you learn to embrace it. You understand that each failure makes you a bit smarter: your estimation should be done more carefully, you now know your users don&rsquo;t like the red color, etc&hellip;</p>

<blockquote>_“When we give ourselves permission to fail, we, at the same time, give ourselves permission to excel.”_

_- Eloise Ristad_</blockquote>


<p>With that in mind - you think more about the process and less about the results.</p>

<h2>5. You understand the power of UX, marketing, etc&hellip;</h2>

<p>In my previous job I was one of 6 developers in 3 dev teams in our department. There were two outsourced designers that I never talked with, 3 product managers that I saw only during planning sessions, and a sales team, somewhere, maybe in the US or maybe one floor above, I&rsquo;m not really sure.</p>

<p>As a server side programmer I never took UX too seriously. I was sure that if the feature is important enough, users are going to use it. I was sure that if we, the devs guys, are going to kick a hell good full product - users will love it. I was sure that there was some secret way that they are going to find it and magically understand how to use all features right off the bat.</p>

<p>I was stupid. UX guys made our users understand our flows, product guys taught us <a href="https://shem8.wordpress.com/2015/08/24/know-what-not-to-build-droidcon-2015/">what not to build</a> and saved us tons of time, our super hero marketing guy brought us to the first place on <a href="http://www.producthunt.com/tech/gallery-doctor-2-0">producthunt</a> and let a huge crowd discover our app right on the first day on launch. A tech product is just like other product, the tech part is just a small piece of the puzzle, so don&rsquo;t feel too special.</p>

<h2>6. You embrace competition</h2>

<p>On the day iOS 7 was released we got many messages from friends. They were all like  "oh not cool, apple just implemented your app in the default photos app, sorry for you guys". We were a bit afraid, and at first we thought &ldquo;ok, we have no chance here&rdquo;. But it turned out to be a good move for us. First - we got some nice free <a href="http://m.blog.laptopmag.com/obsolete-ios-apps?slide=2">PR</a> during the first few days. Second, users started to understand how much this feature was important when browsing their photos and started to look for a dedicated app for that, and we indeed got more downloads over the following months.</p>

<p>Same happened when Dropbox Carousel launched and with Google photos. When the big companies enter the arena you should start to worry, but you should also be flattered, because that means that there is something worth fighting about, and in today’s world - there is plenty of room for you too there.</p>

<blockquote>**Remember: if the Gorilla is blowing down your neck - that means you're on the right track, just run faster =)**</blockquote>


<h2>7. You forget about your comfort zone</h2>

<p>Here is some very small taste of the things that I had the privilege to do over the last 3 years. All are things  that I&rsquo;ve never done before:
<img src="http://cosmic-fitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/comfort-zone-300x206.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<ul>
<li><p>I gave 2 talks on 2 different DroidCon conferences (The biggest Android conference around)</p></li>
<li><p>I delivered tens of pitches in English as part of our startup booth in conferences</p></li>
<li><p>I went over couple to absolute strangers in the middle of the street and asked them to play with our app, just to gather some feedback</p></li>
<li><p>I emailed hundreds of users, closed support tickets and solved their issues</p></li>
<li><p>I went over to the home of one of our investors and worked with her on fixing an issue she had with the app</p></li>
<li><p>I interviewed candidates applying for the company</p></li>
<li><p>I started writing my blog :)</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>8. Nobody is going tell you not to come with flip flops or that the CEO is coming tomorrow so you have to look like you’re working at 8AM</h2>

<p><img src="https://shem8.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/edit.jpg?w=660" alt="edit" /></p>

<p>Yup, you&rsquo;re able to start every Thursday with yoga on the beach and swimming in the sea, and we actually did it.</p>

<hr />

<p>Looks like start-up life is all fun and games , but it&rsquo;s not. It&rsquo;s more like a roller coaster. The ride will take you to some new heights but you are also going to get lots of downs and falls (and I hope I&rsquo;ll write a blog post about it soon). But for all those who want my advice about which one is better - it&rsquo;s more about what kind of person you are and what do you want to achieve. Those small companies that are moving fast are great for learning new things and gaining experience on stuff you probably wouldn&rsquo;t do in a bigger company, but it&rsquo;s also very stressful and chaotic, and you have to be ready for this ride.</p>

<p>As said, I’ve been in these ride over the past 3 years, I can’t say I’ve enjoy every second of it but when looking back, I can’t imagine how far I got and how much I gained from this adventure.</p>

    <link href="http://shem8.github.io/blog/2015/09/11/affectively-reading/"/>
    <updated>2015-09-11T18:16:35+03:00</updated>
    <id>http://shem8.github.io/blog/2015/09/11/affectively-reading</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>The internet is full of great pieces of knowledge. Starting from <a href="http://www.wired.com/2014/10/cheating-video-poker">amazing stories</a> and ending with some <a href="http://www.marcandangel.com/2014/07/06/12-quiet-rituals-of-enormously-successful-humans/">tips from the pros</a>. But because now days <a href="https://shem8.wordpress.com">every shitty twitter user that have a keyboard can open a blog</a> the internet is also full of garbage and texts that not worth your time, and on the other hand you always feel that you missing something, So what can we do?</em></p>

<!--more-->


<p>In this post I&rsquo;ll share with you my experience and my reading habits that I&rsquo;ve developed recently to maximize my reading time by reading exactly what I need and without afraid I&rsquo;m loosing something out there.</p>

<p><strong><em>When I refer to &ldquo;reading&rdquo; on this post I refer to texts on the internet, especially blog posts or interesting articles. I&rsquo;m not talking about books (I hope I&rsquo;ll get to it on another post) or some news content that are not relevant if you read it a month later</em></strong></p>

<hr />

<p>Once upon a time I&rsquo;ve consume all my content via my social networks. First- it was Facebook, my friends were sharing some interesting links and I read them immediately (If I had a minute or two). Fast enough, Facebook algorithm started prioritize media over content, and my Facebook became mix of babies, dogs and oh-look-at-me-I-am-in-a-pool-party feed.</p>

<p>[caption id=&ldquo;&rdquo; align=&ldquo;alignright&rdquo; width=&ldquo;356&rdquo;]<img src="http://i2.wp.com/www.ladycarcar.vn/wp-content/uploads/internet1.jpg?resize=356%2C193" alt="" /> Source: <a href="http://www.ladycarcar.vn/mat-tu-vi-su-dung-cong-nghe/">http://www.ladycarcar.vn/mat-tu-vi-su-dung-cong-nghe/</a>[/caption]</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s when I decided to move to Twitter, and that sure was a mistake. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, Twitter is the best way out there to know what going out right NOW (I barely visiting news sites any more), it is a great platform to meet new people or to get help. But it not that good for discovering some good content, mainly because the users there prefer to keep things short and light.</p>

<p>In that point I went back to the drawing board, things was not worked for me. I had hard time following blogs that was importing for me (instead of reading the last post when it was released via RSS, I visited the blog once in a while and read all the posts I&rsquo;ve missed). I didn&rsquo;t have time to read those links on Facebook and finding them later was impossible. And when I finally had time I didn&rsquo;t had any way to explore new cool content.</p>

<h2>Step 1: Create your reading ritual</h2>

<p>Reading demand some certain state of mind. For me, for example, reading on my smartphone didn't worked so well, because it&rsquo;s too small and also because there are so many notifications and I lost my focus easily. After trying all kinds of things it look like my (wife&rsquo;s) iPad works the best. It also works great for me because I&rsquo;m doing my reading as part of my <a href="http://stevecorona.com/morning-rituals-1-10-1000/">morning ritual</a> so I don&rsquo;t have to grab it with me elsewhere. So my reading ritual is on the morning with a cup a tea, looking at the sea from my living room window with an iPad to read.</p>

<h2>Step 2: Find your platform</h2>

<p>Now you need to build some mechanism for saving your reading queue. I&rsquo;m using <a href="https://getpocket.com">Pocket</a> and I really think it is the best one out there. What&rsquo;s important from this platform is:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Easy to insert (add to the queue)</p></li>
<li><p>Easy to pull (get the next for reading)</p></li>
<li><p>It is also nice to have some tagging, sharing and search functionality.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Pocket surly served the first 2 items: there is a <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/save-to-pocket/niloccemoadcdkdjlinkgdfekeahmflj?hl=en">chrome extension</a>, and android app that let you add articles quickly, and an app for almost all platforms for reading.</p>

<p>Make sure that you have one and only platform and all the content you consume should be from there. Even if you saw something on Facebook, or a friend send some link on mail- add it to your reading list and read it from there, I&rsquo;ll explain why in the next step:</p>

<h2>Step 3: Fill some content</h2>

<p>So now we have all the infrastructure ready, how do we put something in? I will divide it to 3:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Your direct channels- Those are the posts that you know that you don&rsquo;t wanna miss, like important blogs or interesting medium users. You want all those posts will be added automaticity to your platform.</p></li>
<li><p>Specific aggregator/ digested list- This one is tricky. In &ldquo;The Tipping Point" Malcolm Gladwell says that on most of the times, it&rsquo;s better to ask a maven instead of learning things on yourself. If you, like me, can&rsquo;t handle all the blogs out there, not knowing all the bloggers and sites- find your maven that will send you the most important things out there.</p></li>
<li><p>Recommendation engine- This one is the best for exploring some new stuff that not necessary fit to your main interest. This can be some algorithm that based on the crowd source or you personal taste (or better- both). That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s important to manage all your reading thought the same platform to give it as much information as possible for future learning.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Those 3 aspects should fill some nice and variety reading list. Here is my reading list:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>As Android developer- the <a href="http://android-developers.blogspot.co.il/">Android blog</a> is really important to me and I want to know on any additional API or new features there is. I&rsquo;m also interested on every thing <a href="https://medium.com/@chethaase">Chet Haase</a> is publishing. And with <a href="https://ifttt.com/">IFTTT</a> it easily added to my pocket every time new item is publish.</p></li>
<li><p>3 years ago I discover the wonderful <a href="http://softwareleadweekly.com/">software lead weekly</a> project, I&rsquo;m getting 1 weekly mail with the most interesting stuff out there about startup culture and leadership. And thanks to the awesome <a href="https://twitter.com/orenellenbogen">Oren Ellenbogen</a> there is a simple &lsquo;Add to pocket&rsquo; option.</p></li>
<li><p>Pocket is doing amazing work here, and send me every week couple of articles that might interesting me (I say amazing because it&rsquo;s pretty accurate). Lately I also started using medium, and it&rsquo;s recommendation emails are nice too.</p></li>

<h2>Step 4: Find your pace</h2>

<p>I know lots of people that did it all but their Pocket app is just an endless list. They keep adding some stuff and never got to read half of them, soon enough they give up because they know there is no chance they gonna keep the pace. Start with small amount of articles, it&rsquo;s better to have an empty list and not a too long one that will make you give up. After you will make it an habit it will be easier to add more stuff, so you always need to iterate between step 3 and 4.</p>

<p>For me- I started with reading around a few articles in the end of the week. That was build by 2 or 3 from the &ldquo;software lead weekly&rdquo; mail and maybe 2 more from the pocket mail. Step by step I increase my reading capacity and now I&rsquo;m reading 3 articles a day = 15 a week. And adding around the same amount (Android= 3, software lead weekly= 4-5, Pocket= 4-5, medium= 3-4).</p>

<p>It took me couple of years but I really feel like my reading ritual helped me learn a lot of new things (about Android, tech and also on some other things that I&rsquo;ve never read about). Yes- of course, I still sometimes facing some &ldquo;What the hell I&rsquo;ve just read in the last 4 minutes&rdquo; moments, or skipping some important announcements because I don&rsquo;t have time. But you know- you can&rsquo;t always win the internet, winning 80% of the time is fine with me =)</p>
