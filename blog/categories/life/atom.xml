<!-- more -->

These are strange and sometimes intimidating times. A global epidemic rocked our world and changed a lot of the things that we thought are rock solid. Paths that seemed straight forward now took a sudden turn. Many of us need to adapt and adjust, and we need to do it fast which makes it even more daunting.

Already at this point, we can say that what hurt most is the economy: unemployment rate rise, retails sales plunge, and the global economy is probably going to change a lot in 2020. Many companies are reducing their workforce (if not already), some will completely shut down, and almost everybody going back to the drawing board to see how to handle this situation.

What also got hit, but without us realize the numbers, is the people's mental health. We already [know that humans don't cope well with the unknown](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7075936/).

And between all these, there's you and me, and many more - the employees who aren't sure what will be with their position, their promotion, their team, their bonuses or generally their future in the company. This uncertainty can continue for weeks and even months, and we all should be prepared.

Unfortunately, In my last 3 jobs that spread across 8 years, I had to tackle a lot of situations similar to this (more or less, because in the end of the day, a global epidemic is something that we see once in 100 years). I don't know if this is because of me and my risk-taking nature, or the fast pacing industry that we live in, but every once in a while I found myself up in the air without a solid ground in the landscape. I specifically chose 3 stories from my career that are very different from each other and taught me different lessons.

In those situations, I saw people completely losing it while others bury their heads in the sand and wait till it over. With time I learned how to embrace those conditions and understand this is a crucial part of me as a human and how you make lemonade from those lemons.
But before we begin, something needs to be said - as I mentioned, we, as humans, don't deal well with uncertainty. [Daniel Kahneman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Kahneman) wrote plenty about this subject. So please don't feel bad that these times paralyze you or make is discomfort. Stress, sleep deprivation, and nervousness is completely common and legit. Even after I learned how to live with this uncertainty I still have some panic attacks from time to time, and this is another thing that you should embrace.

With that in mind, let's get back in time:

<img class="center" src="/images/posts/uncertainty/1.gif" title="Credit: @gilcoh" >

## Story 1: The Startup

Ah, 2015, the days where I was young, naive, optimist, and thinking that parenting will be a piece of cake. In other words - an idiot. It was my 4th year in a startup. we had great momentum, right on time for our second round of funding. But startups being startups, everything changed in a very short time.

Making a long story short - the company faced some obstacles and we had to take a pay cut for a few months. All we left to do is to sit until the management would pull off any financial solutions. Everyone was told that they can find a new place or to wait to see if they can get their missing salaries retroactive along with some bonuses.

In addition to all this, our first child was born, as a young 20 something couple, we were shocked and mainly overwhelmed (ok ok, me more than my wife), and soon enough we discovered that she suffers from serious allergies but no one knew from what.

This is how I found myself, a new father that is trying to understand what's going on, with low salary, running between hospitals, without any mental capacity to decide what is the right thing to do regarding the startup.

After a week where I was extremely sick and with no sleep at all, I had a long discussion with my wonderful wife. I found it amazing that she was completely calm and functioning as usual and asked her for help. And she taught me 2 things that helped me a lot to go over this period:

- **Don't beat yourself about things that you can't control:** I was wondering all day and night (especially night) and torture myself "what if": what if my daughter will suffer more, what if she will stay like this forever, what if the startup will shutdown, what if all my options will go to waste. But thinking about it wouldn't change the situation, it is what it is. So I decided to let things happen and focus on things that under my control: spending time with my daughter and make her laugh, helping my wife and give her the time to work, and give our founders the time to do their best.

- **Take a decision for a defined timeframe, and don't look back:** many times you're facing a crossroads where you need to decide what turn to take with limited data. For me, it was whether to stay and wait for the money or to forget about it and move with my life to the next gig. I could take the numbers and analyze it forever but no one can really know what will happen, so I decided that it's a good time for me to take a break anyway. After this decision was finalized I decided that in the coming 3 months I won't think about it and that is it.

## Story 2: The Corporate

In the end, the bet paid off and we were acquired by a big company. Soon enough I understand that this isn't for me and I looked for something else. After a couple of months, I found a very nice startup that I liked. I went to other places, but I realized that I fell in love with that startup and decided to blow off the rest.

Naive as I was, I went to my manager and asked to quit (and relinquished a lot of money as part of the acquisition). Later that day I got some bad news - the startup had some issues, causing them to start a hiring freeze for the next few months. My new job offer was canceled. Out of nowhere, I found myself without a job and throwing too much money to trash.

I wasn't ready to start looking for a new job, something that probably would have taken a few weeks. In the next 2 weeks, I did everything to get my job back, I tried to explain to my corporate managers that my plans were completely mixed up and begged them to take me back, I also offered to take the lead on a project that no one else wanted to take. Eventually, they agreed, but those 2 weeks were a nightmare, especially because of how surprising it was and how fast I went from hero to zero. During those days I learned 2 lessons:

- **It's easier to handle the worst-case scenario than to imagine it:** as one that came from a lower-middle-class house, being unemployed was one of my worst nightmares. Suddenly as it became a reality it wasn't that scary since I knew exactly how to get out of this situation. You need to remember- the uncertainty is making you much more difficult than the actual thing that's going to happen.

- **Always have a plan B:** I was so confident that everything will go smoothly, I didn't even consider the alternatives. In life, shit happens, so when things start rolling, you better have one or two fallbacks in case things go south. That's how you can have more control and less uncertainty in tricky situations.

## Story 3: The Roller Coaster

For the last story, I want to jump to the last 6 months, that was certainly shaking, to say the least. In addition to a global epidemic that completely changed the world and shut down many businesses, I was working in a company that's in the co-working industry and the business was highly affected. That's in addition to all the chaos going on even before the COVID-19.

It was a very stressful 6 months period that started in October - by now you can probably guess which company I'm talking about, so I will just mention my plans on the downsizing of the technological org. But it was clear right from the beginning, that I should start to prepare. Learned from my previous experience I knew I needed to think deeply about what's next and plan for a couple of options. I took the time and started checking all my alternatives, taking it easy knowing I have a couple of months to do the market research, mapping the options, and prepare for interviews (this was the first time in my career that I'm going to be in the interviewee seat and actually do whiteboard questions).

The preparation helped when the uncertainty levels got higher and higher (and it surely went pretty high). It also paid off because I got what I wanted in May and found a place that hopefully will be exactly what I wanted. I still had some restless nights but I saw the difference and the toll it had on some peers.

What helped me most to go over these challenges times was mainly:

- **Take a timeout-** most of the things in these kinds of situations won't be under your control, so instead of focusing on those things. Find your anchor and go back to the things you can handle and you might help you reduce the stress: get some rest, spending time with your friends and family, read books, practice, and find new hobbies. This is the best time to care for yourself since it's probably a time where there's not much of a workload, and you don't need to think about the next performance circle.

- **Prepare in advance-** for most of the cases, a crisis won't come out of nowhere. For the majority of the strong businesses, the COVID-19 hit hard but they'll recover sooner or later, for businesses that were not prepared, COVID-19 pushed them off balance and some into a death spiral. When shit hits the fan things will go fast and stress will kick in, you want to be prepare beforehand and thus when the uncertainty will come, you'll be ready.

## Wrapping Up

The employment landscape is changing at a fast pace, due to employees, fast-growing companies, and the crazy financial landscape. That brings a constant level of uncertainty that adds up. Whether we like it or not, with this pace comes uncertainty at times and we have to create the tools for ourselves to handle it.

In this post, I described a couple of times in my career when I needed to handle uncertainty, and you saw it happens both in small and big companies. Here are some points to pay attention that can help you go over these hard times (without any particular order):

- **Don't beat yourself about things that you can't control.**
- **Take a decision for a defined timeframe, and don't look back.**
- **It's easier to handle the worst-case scenario than to imagine it.**
- **Always have a plan B.**
- **Take a timeout.**
- **Prepare in advance.**

---

And remember - it's hard. Most of the people don't handle these kinds of events well. Try to share and talk with the people around you, it's much easier to handle it with a group than alone.

**TL;DR: If most of the messages you're sending to candidates look something like this, you probably want to read the rest of the post:**

> Hi X, what's up?

> I'm Y from Company Z.

> I am not sure if you have heard of Company Z, but we have been yada yada yada. We also do this and that. We're big and stable company that always doing new things. We're working hard and care about work-life balance.

> I would love for us to connect and talk about a new job opportunity that matches your profile. Here's a completely random list of things that we need from a perfect candidate.
>
> Would you be interested in learning more about this position? I would be happy to get your phone number to talk and explain more.

In the past 6 months, I had the pleasure to get many messages on LinkedIn. I contribute it less to my skills and more to the hundreds of articles the media wrote about my workplace- WeWork.

As a software engineer, LinkedIn is the only social network that I actually get messages from others, and I would lie if I say it doesn't flatter me. Having said that, 99% of the messages that I got are not relevant and are pretty much a waste of time for both sides. Nevertheless, I still try to answer most messages kindly and professionally.

I think, that with a couple of easy steps, recruiters can improve their approaches to candidates (and maybe skip on the ones that are not relevant). This way they can save time and have a better chance to close the deal with candidates.

Some of the things that I'm going to suggest may sound silly, but from my experience, recruiters often fail there. It's also might seem very time consuming, but in my perspective, it's better to send 1 good message than 5 generic ones.

I divided my tips into 3 categories, so take a pen and paper and make sure you follow:

## 1. Professional

#### Don't misspell my name

Starting with what seems like an easy one. Come on, it's right there in my profile, just copy and paste, it's just four letters and it's not even French. How hard could it be?!

<img class="center" src="/images/posts/recuruters/1.png" title="&#34;Hi Shaham&#34;. My name is Shem =(" alt="&#34;Hi Shaham&#34;. My name is Shem =(">

#### Use the right terminology

I know, engineers have so many acronyms and phrases that normal people can't follow. And I know that many times you just copy and paste what you got from the hiring manager. But there are times when what you write doesn't make sense. Please go over the technical parts with the hiring manager and make sure your phrasing makes sense

In my previous job every couple of months, the hiring team had 101 sessions with someone from the engineering department about basic stuff and terms. It helped them to have a basic discussion and moreover - confidence, when texting, taking on the phone, or when they're on a booth at a conference.

And for the ones that are working in non-English speaking markets - please use English (at least for the technical terms).

#### Be formal

I don't expect you to open every message with "Dear X" or use words like [pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest_word_in_English), but opening your note with "What's up bro" or "yo man" isn't the best way to make me want to continue reading.

<img class="center" src="/images/posts/recuruters/2.png" title="&#34;What's up Shaham&#34;. I don't even..." alt="&#34;What's up Shaham&#34;. I don't even...">

#### Keep it short

If you'll write too much, people will just skim over the text. Polish the core of your offer and let the other side ask for the relevant items if needed.

#### Show some empathy

There are times you approach candidates after bad news or crisis in their workplace if this is the case and you choose to mention the situation at that company please be sensitive about it. This is not the best feeling for anyone to be in a sinking ship, especially when he has many friends there.

## 2. Relevant

#### Know the candidate

I know you're aiming to reach as many candidates as possible, and if you'll need to research each one of them it won't end. But I think that investing a couple of minutes before sending a message can actually save you time. By sending a more tailor-made request that will speak better to the person - the engagement will just be higher.

Even if you don't have time to do a small research about each candidate, there are general things that people care about when they're thinking about their career. [For example](https://hired.com/state-of-software-engineers#coding) the #1 reason most software engineers chose their career is "new challenges and continuous learning" beating "earning potential". Their #1 goal in the next 10 years: continue building cool things. Focus on those things and how these correlate with your company.

#### Know what the company is looking

You should also do the opposite research - about what the company currently needs, especially if you're working in an agency and don't work in the company. A few question that you can ask the hiring manager:

1. What requirements are defiantly a must? Not the "I need a React developer, but Angular is close enough". Also not "X years experience with Y", years of experience don't mean seniority. Tell me exactly what you need.

2. Do you prefer someone with specific knowledge or you prefer someone that can learn new things?

3. Are you looking for someone with a tracked record or a junior that will grow with the company?

4. Do you need someone that is hands-on or more high level?

<img class="center" src="/images/posts/recuruters/3.png" title="ALL THE BUZZWORDS (and more)" >

#### Show me

Every company says that they are working on the latest frameworks, with cutting edge technologies. It's nice that you know to work hard but to be aware of the work-life balance of their employees. Instead of throwing words in the air, show me. Attach some useful links to your blog describing cool things that you built, point me to resources that support your culture.

## 3. Unique

#### Don't copy & paste

Please, you can easily spot a canned message that you just copy and send to everyone. Not to mention the times that you forgot to remove the "CANDIDATE NAME" filler, or the times that you sent me the same message after a couple of weeks. I don't expect you to sit and write a new message from scratch every time, but at least change the 2–3 opening sentences.

<br />
<div class="row">
  <div class="column"><img src="/images/posts/recuruters/4.png"></div>
  <div class="column"><img src="/images/posts/recuruters/5.png"></div>
  <div class="column"><img src="/images/posts/recuruters/6.png"></div>
</div>

#### Why your company is different

I'm sure your company is special, I want to believe that every company is special in its way. Think about what makes it one of a kind and how it'll align with the candidate. Because in the end of the day people want to feel special.

Also - be honest with yourself and what you bring to the table. There's no way that your company is perfect, that it's a startup that gives the employees the time to explore new technologies and has many mentors that help them grow. Or the other way around - that this is a big corporate that everyone has a ton of impact. This just can't be the case and every time you write it just hurts your credibility.

#### Stand out

You want to somehow attract attention and not just be one of the many messages in the candidate's inbox. Keep in mind that this is important but can also be dangerous. There's a thin line between standing out and trying too much. Also, like you, many people read posts like this and in the end of the day all the messages look the same, so you need to keep an eye and refresh it from time to time.

---

_To summarize, your approach should be professional, relevant, and unique. This will give you superior results when talking with candidates and also save you precious time._

    <link href="http://blog.shem.dev/blog/2019/05/03/three-great-startups-i-could-build-if-google-would-give-me-access-to-their-data/"/>
    <updated>2019-05-03T14:06:12+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.shem.dev/blog/2019/05/03/three-great-startups-i-could-build-if-google-would-give-me-access-to-their-data</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[_(It’s actually my data. Just saying.)_
<!-- more -->

I love Google; I use their products every day. Besides the search engine, I love Google Photos, I have an Android phone, and I use Gmail (RIP Inbox), Maps, Docs, Slides, Sheets, and many more.

On the other hand, I’m an engineer, and I love building products, especially ones that make my life easier. That’s why I created an [app to split the bill](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.bill.splitter) between friends when sitting in a restaurant, or a [web app to track my expenses](https://expense.shem.dev/). In the past couple of years, I had many ideas about cool features that I could use in all those products I’m using. I could wait for the relevant product managers to build those features in the corresponding products, but you know what it’s like with Google’s product managers:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Google interviewer: what do you do when a product—<br>PM candidate: SHUT IT DOWN<br>GI: THAT IS CORRECT SOMEONE MAKE A JOB OFFER TO THIS MAN</p>&mdash; Florent Crivello (@Altimor) <a href="https://twitter.com/Altimor/status/1113641671353192449?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 4, 2019</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>


So basically I was alone here, and I needed (and also wanted) to build those tools by myself.

But building a new product is hard. Not because you need to write the code from scratch — that’s usually the easy part. It’s hard because you need to find a user base, to teach them how to use your product, to build the right interface and make sure they won’t leave. That’s why it’s easier to write your thoughts on Medium and not open your own blog, or open a Facebook page for your business instead of maintaining a dedicated website with chat and notifications and all.

In my example, as an engineer who wants to build stuff, the equivalent for that is using other product’s data and user interface. For example, instead of using a dedicated app to back up my good photos — I use [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/) to upload every photo that I post to Instagram directly to Dropbox.

As mentioned before, because I’m using many Google products in my day-to-day life, I thought I could leverage those apps to build some helpful products (for me) based on them.

Here’s a partial list of ideas I had lately and after some research, I understood pretty quickly that it’ll be hard to do with the current options I have in hand.

_A note: All these product names are WIP. I’m better at engineering than I’m at marketing._

## 1. Commute Optimizer
As someone who spends almost 2 hours commuting each day, this is a big aspect of my life that I would love to optimize. You might not know it, but if you have the Google Maps app on your phone, [it tracks every step you make during the day](https://www.apnews.com/828aefab64d4411bac257a07c1af0ecb), whether you drive to work or go to your supermarket on the next block to buy some milk.

You can like it or not, but this is the price you pay for using Google Maps (or Google in general). I for one, feel that it’s a reasonable price to pay, given the tremendous help I get from those apps and how much more comfortable my life is with Google.

So putting privacy concerns aside, the data is there, and [you can see it](https://www.google.com/maps/timeline). But what can you do with it (aside from getting tailor-made ads)?

What if I could take all this data, process it, see some patterns and understand what is the best time for me to leave home to catch the bus to work or when to leave home when there’s less traffic? The Google Maps app already has a couple of years of data and running a simple algorithm (that also learns and gets feedback) and can give me some good insights.

#### Why can’t I do it?

So the idea is pretty simple, right? The only problem is the data isn’t easily accessible. There’s no API for your timeline and the only way to get it is to [download a huge JSON file](https://takeout.google.com/settings/takeout/custom/location_history?pli=1). This is definitely not the optimal way for a third party app to pull this data, and also the data won’t update, so the app isn’t able to improve.

Moreover, the data Google exports for you is the raw locations. Right — the raw data gives you more options to do whatever you want, but Google already does the calculations and gives you great insights about when you walked and when you started driving —if Google gave you __this__ kind of data, this would be a much easier way to work with the data!

## 2. “On This Day” Wallpaper
I already talked about Google Photos and how much I love it. As someone who worked for a couple of years on a gallery app, I admire the people in Google that are working on this product. They are doing a fantastic job both on the product side and on the technical side, plus — the UI is slick, elegant and straightforward.

That’s why ALL my photos are in Google Photos (and on a physical hard drive, just in case). Same for my wife.

So how cool would it be if every day, I could have different wallpaper, remind me something great from the past? I could get a photo of my wife and I and our two children (or a subset of this group) that was taken on the same day a couple of years ago and have a nice small moment every day. The app would change the wallpaper every day (or a couple of times a day if there are a couple of photos).

#### Why can’t I do it?

This idea actually came to me when Google announced the new Photos API a few months ago. I immediately started building an app and playing with the API to see what I can do.

The plan was to get all the different people shown in your library’s photos, just like Google Photos has when you start searching, then let you pick a couple of people that you want to get their photos. From there I would run every day and select the pictures with those people on specific dates.

Sounds relatively simple right?

That was until I figured out the API might give you some interface to [query photos with people](https://developers.google.com/photos/library/reference/rest/v1/mediaItems/search#ContentCategory) but doesn't give you an option to play with the actual people that are in the picture (that’s the difference between [face detection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_detection) and [face recognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facial_recognition_system)). On top of that, the team even said that they [wouldn’t support it](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/80089805) in the future.

## 3. Words practice
As you probably notice d— English is not my native language. Therefore I’m using Google Translate a lot when I’m reading and don’t understand a specific word or when I’m writing and don’t know what is the right word is.

Google Translate is great because it’s available on all platforms — whether I’m writing a document on my desktop, reading an email on my Android phone or reading an article on my iPad. It also has a simple UI and useful features like the word’s full definition, frequency of each translation, synonyms and listening.

What if I could use Google to build an [Anki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anki_%28software%29) app that would use [spaced repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition) to help me learn and memorize the words I constantly forget. It could also help me enrich my vocabulary by suggesting new words related to what I usually use.


#### Why can’t I do it?

The only API Google provides here is to translate words. This is great, but this is not what I’m looking for. I’m looking to get my own data and usage on the app. There’s an [“history”](https://support.google.com/translate/answer/6142479) option in the web version, but it’s only valid for the specific session and not accessible via any API call. Another solution is to use the [“phrasebook”](https://support.google.com/translate/answer/6142480) feature and export it, but this means I need to manually star every translation and manually export my phrasebook every couple of weeks, a very tedious process that I wish to automate.

Yes, there’s always the option to write a translator app on my own, Google helps me with the API, but again — I’ll need to build and maintain(!) a multiplatform app with all the important features I described above.

This is not a rant
I’m not blaming Google for anything here. This is their product, they invested tons of man-years, brain cycles and money to come up with those amazing products and I understand why they don’t want other people to easily use the company’s massive work for their own good. But at the same time, I think this is a great opportunity for them to grow and attract new users. Maybe this wallpaper thing will encourage more people to put all their photos in Google, or if this words app existed — I would use Google Translate and only Google Translate.

I also understand those product managers that want to keep the options open and maybe add those features on Google products in the future, and thus not open APIs to other developers. It's much better than the alternative — to pull a Twitter on other developers and deprecate APIs out of nowhere, but I genuinely think those features are so small and not really in the core of the business, so I can’t see why it would even get near those products.

These are not billion dollar company ideas; if there were — I wouldn't put them here out in the open. And for me — the best case here is that Google would just add it somehow, but since I don’t see this happening, I would love to see them offer some options on top of what they already have. It doesn’t need to be specified in the ways I described above, but generally — shift the state of mind and think:

> “we’re building great products, how can the community can leverage it?”

The dear year of 2018 — You’ve gone by fast, maybe too fast. A moment before saying goodbye I wanted to thank you for the lessons you gave me.

## 1. Focus
Starting from the most important lesson, the one that probably made this post being a list of only four items and not a dozen. Having two children, with significant challenges at work- I _had_ to separate the important stuff from the noise. Two books mainly inspired me here (one old and one new): [The 4-Hour Workweek](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/368593.The_4_Hour_Workweek) and [It Doesn’t Have to Be Crazy at Work](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38900866-it-doesn-t-have-to-be-crazy-at-work).

I removed tons of distractions from my day to day (more about that later). First, I reduced the emails and other not urgent communications channels to strictly twice a day, 30 min each, and disabled notifications for all of them. Surprisingly enough- it’s working, and the world didn’t fall.

I also expanded an experiment I started the year before, and every evening I put my phone on flight mode until the next morning and putting it back on only when I’m going out of my house.

When I’m in a situation- I’m fully present: when I’m with my kids, I found it’s better to be there less time but with 100% of my attention. When at work I split it into two mindsets: (1) in the zone, writing, deeply thinking with my self, and (2) being there for others, tackling difficult problems, giving guidance. Today’s workspace is trying to provide one solution to both, and I don’t think it’s possible. Lucky enough- I’m working in such environment that has the answers for both- open spaces for collaboration and dedicates quite zones for isolation. So either I sit (or stand actually) in my place without earphones, putting my radar on and helping others, or blocking a dedicated time in the calendar and go work from another room or even a different building.

I learned (and still learning) how to put my attention on the right things and reduce the context switches to a minimum. It is an art that will boost your productivity. The secret is to do the same with less, and than add a bit to it

## 2. Strengthen my weaknesses
Until last year I focus on sharping the things I felt I was good at but not enough. When developed on Android, I dig deeper and explore new things like Kotlin at the time or how to do advanced animations. Same for public speaking- I push on talking on more events, sharpen my communication skills and get better on how to speak in front of an audience.

As I improved, I realized I was reaching my limit. My other weaker capabilities were holding me back, blocking my way in improving my stronger skills. There were two main areas I felt lagging behind: English and Web development.

Starting from the latter- as a full-stack developer that did lots of backend and mobile, I felt I was still missing the basics of web development, primarily as someone that most of the day working on React apps in my day to day and didn’t work with JS a lot during my career. So I started reading more and more blog posts about JS and React (sorry, I still [can’t handle CSS](/blog/2017/08/25/how-to-become-a-css-master/) and signed for newsletters (one that I highly recommend is [React status](https://react.statuscode.com/)). I also did what I usually do when I want to learn a new thing and [build a side project](/blog/2018/06/08/the-ultimate-guide-for-side-projects/)- a web application to help me and my wife track and monitor our expenses.

As for my English skills- as I imagine you already noticed, English is not my native language, and it’s not natural for me to express myself in writing or by speaking. So besides reading more books in English, I decided to double down on it and took two courses (that my amazing work completely covered): Talera for writing and speaking and [The Accent Way](https://theaccentsway.com/) to improve my accent. I’m also using this blog for practicing my writing skills, so thank you for participating in my experiment =).

Sometimes you need to stop or even go a couple of steps back to gain some velocity for the future.

## 3. Sometimes you need to come back to your comfort zone
I’m a big believer in trying new things and push your limits, and I already wrote that I think the magic happens [outside of the comfort zone](/blog/2015/11/15/run-fast-fall-frequently-get-up-faster-and-go-drink-beer-at-the-beach-what-its-like-to-work-at-a-startup/). But staying there too long might be exhausted. I learned it the hard way because this year I started talking in conferences abroad.

It actually started at the end of 2017, but in 2018 I took the leap and talked in big conferences in Europe, not in my native language. It began on [Devfest Kosice](https://devfest.sk/) in Slovakia, then on [ADC Festival](https://www.adc.de/kongress/) in Hamburg and lastly on [BrainBar conference](https://brainbar.com/) in Budapest. Although I had experience in talking in front of big audiences, this was different. The combination of speaking in English, traveling for a couple of days alone, and standing on the stage without any familiar face in the crowd- was very hard for me. Very hard. So hard that I started to enjoy it less and less.

After the last talk, I felt overwhelmed and needed to take a break and breathe. So I took some time off and didn’t submit any talks for the rest of the year. Almost eight months have passed, and I’ve started to miss speaking in confs. Soon I might be ready to submit new talks, and hopefully, I’ll return talking and enjoying it again.

Being outside of the comfort zone will take plenty of energy and might be a stressful situation, just remember to come back and fill your battery before going back.

## 4. Be conscious about the content I consume
As said before, I started to be more aware to how I’m using my time. I already heavily use [Pocket](https://getpocket.com/) in the past couple of years, but this year I started listening to podcasts too (a partial list: [Stuff You Should Know](https://www.stuffyoushouldknow.com/podcasts), [Planet Money](https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510289/planet-money), [99% Invisible](https://99percentinvisible.org/), [Replay All](https://www.gimletmedia.com/reply-all), and in Hebrew: [Extend](http://extend.libsyn.com/), [Hayot Kiss](https://www.kan.org.il/podcast/program.aspx/?progid=7), [Ma Yesh Beze](https://mayeshbeze.simplecast.fm/) and [No Tarbut](http://notarbut.co/)). Also, after too much time, I moved to Kindle from physical books, and that made me read much more.

But more important, I got rid of useless habits that took my attention too easily: I removed the Facebook app from my phone and slowly decreased the times I visit the social network, to the point that I open it only once a week. I stopped visiting websites to read the news or watch commercial TV. Instead, I only watch on-demand shows and get the news from small talk with other people.

Our world is full of data, noise, and content. Almost all of it is not worth your time. The most precious resource you have is your time and your attention, don’t give it for free. Treat your mind as your body and don’t feed it with junk food.


# A look forward
I want to use my time more wisely; I want to do the same with less and get more time to explore new things; I want to get excited again when seeing the crowd from the stage side; I want to push the right limits.

__2019, we can do it.__

    <id>http://blog.shem.dev/blog/2018/10/12/30-lessons-for-my-30th-birthday-learned-from-my-many-mistakes</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[Last month was my 30th birthday. I’m not an emotional guy that loves to celebrate his birthday, and I don’t think there is something unique in this day. For me, it’s just 10950 days since I was born, nothing special.
<!-- more -->

Anyway, since many of my friends think (and most of the people in the world apparently) it’s an important date, I thought it might be worth to take a moment and observe what I’ve learned in the past not-so-long-but-also-not-so-short period, just a reminder for me to not repeat the hundreds of mistakes I did.

_*this list is not on any order, it was random and shown by the order that it came in my mind in the last couple of weeks._

### #1: Don’t listen to stupid lists on the internet

“10 things every successful people knows”, “5 habits for helping you become a millionaire”, “30 pieces of advice from a pretty normal guy”. Everyone thinks he figured life out, that’s probably not the case because everyone has their way of doing things. Getting inspiration from other people is great- but try to find what exactly works for you, it’s probably not the same for others.

### #2: Read, but for real.
People nowadays barely read more than two paragraphs. This is the point where most people’s (from the ones that even started) eyes will start itching, and they will lose it. Don’t be like this, there are few articles worth reading, but if you find something interesting- take the time and read it slowly. Give the author the respect he deserves.

### #3: Your immediate family is the most important thing you have in life
Those are the ones you are waking up with every morning and go to sleep near them every night. Those will (hopefully) be with you during all your life no matter what you’ll do or where you’ll be. For good and bad.

### #4: Fight to preserve connections, but not too much
There are close people that your relationship with them might have a bad impact on your life or mental health, or it’s simply taking too much energy from your side, and you’re not getting anything back. Drop it, it probably not worth it.

### #5: Learning is an ongoing effort
You don’t finish your learning phase in high school or college; learning is not just a phase in life, it happens all the time. Furthermore, those places need to prepare you for the actual learning in real life. Learn how to learn, this is how you’ll hack life for the long run.

### #6: If you aren’t going forward- you’re going backward
We live in times where everything is going at such a fast pace. Things that you learned in your Bachelor degree are probably already outdated. Did you learn how to do a certain thing two years ago? There’s probably a better way to do it now. Keep on going.

### #7: The magic happens outside your comfort zone
Get out, try things, push yourself, push others, this is less scary than you imagine. There’re lots of stuff that you can’t experience in your comfort zone or will just take too much time to learn.

### #8: To feel the ground, go down
The one who sits in the front desk knows much more of the other people about what happens in the day-to-day. Do you want to know if people in your company are stating to burn out? Ask the cleaners- they’re the ones in the office at 8 am or 8 pm.

### #9: Go say “hi” to the new guy
Remember when you’re the new guy? That was pretty scary. So go and ask the one that eats alone at his table if he or she wants to join you, they will remember it.

### #10: People hate awkward silence
If you pause enough time during a conversation, the other side will start talking. People LOVE talking, especially about themselves.

### #11: One on one is the best way to get to know people
I didn’t yet find one person that I sat with him alone that I hate him afterward. Talk with people enough time, ask him questions, get interested and I bet you’ll find something interesting about him that you can learn from.

### #12: Consistency is the key to improvement
The only way to get better in order of magnitude is by improving by little every day for a long time. Jerry Seinfeld had a great method to write better jokes- he wrote one joke every single day. It doesn’t matter how funny the joke was- as long he came up with a new one every day, no matter what happened that day. After doing it for enough time, all he had in mind is [“Your only job is to not break the chain.”](https://jamesclear.com/stop-procrastinating-seinfeld-strategy)

### #13: It won’t be as bad as you imagine (neither as good)
The worst thing you can think about a particular situation (moving to another city, talking in front of an audience, getting fired), will probably won’t be that hard in reality. The same thing also for the best case. So calm down.

### #14: When hard times come- people looking for God
Or something similar to God, or something they consider as God. The French philosopher Pascal’s Wager argued that a rational person should live as though God exists and seek to believe in God, it also has some comfort.

### #15: A favor is worth much more than a couple of bucks
Try to do things for others without any material incentive, just help them. When money is involved, and you’ll need their help in the future- they will be able to ask some amount of money depends on how much money they paid, but favors are like comparing apples to oranges, and people will be more generous in this case.

### #16: Guided imagery is real
When facing a hard problem — stop and take a moment to plan how exactly you’re going to solve it. Imagine you actually address the thing, step by step and how you’re going to overcome any obstacles along the way. Only then start.

### #17: Be polite
Say “Thank you” and “Welcome,” smile, be kind, even if the other side not cooperate. In most cases, it only needs the right word to make a challenging situation to be a pleasant one.

### #18: Hard things just look easy
When you see someone nailing it on the stage, feeling light, that seems like he was born to do it, and they’re giving a 30 minute performance so naturally — this is just because they practice the hell out of it for at least 100 hours and could not eat anything since breakfast because they’re so stressed.

### #19: Stop wasting time watching TV
There’s plenty of great content out there; TV is 99% shit that aims for the least common ground and acts as a filler for commercials.

### #20: Facebook does not reflect real life
For 99% of the people in 99% of the time- life is just dull moments, daydreaming, staring at the air and nothing to write about. Facebook feed is a collection of all the best moments of some people (and a ton of ads in between). So you can stop the feeling of “everyone doing some pretty cool things all the time, while I’m sitting in my pajamas doing my best becoming a couch potato.”

### #21: Put down the camera
You can’t capture magic moments in life with the camera (ok, some people can, but 99% can’t), so please stop wasting time on these precious moments for taking dozens of pictures you’ll never watch. Take a snapshot in memory; it will look much better.

### #22: Learn how to express yourself
A language is a fantastic tool; it’s like plasticine that you, the writer, can shape. You can excite or hurt the readers just by picking the right words. It can be played like music that can make your eyes run fast to follow the words to see what’s going to happen at the end of the sentence. Or to slow down, taking the time to understand. The ability to describe a situation and to make the reader actually feel the words is a powerful skill. Read, learn new words, practice writing.

### #23: Learn by doing
At the end of the day, this is the only way to acquire a new skill; you can’t avoid this.

### #24: Surround yourself with the right people
[You are the average of the five people you most associate with.](https://www.businessinsider.com/tim-ferriss-average-of-five-people-2017-1) Putting yourself in situations where you’re the smartest one in the room might make you feel great, but it won’t take you anywhere. Analyze what you should get better at and find the right people that will take you there.

### #25: Find mentors (and keep them close)
Mentors are like gold in a world where you want to keep getting forward. Find great mentors and don’t even think about letting them go until you learn from them everything you need.

### #26: Step 0 for improvement: measure
You can’t trust a gut feeling. When it comes to growth — numbers are the keys. By measuring you’ll know what the low hanging fruits (and there probably are) and how to make quick wins. A before and after graph/ image/ sheet is what will motivate you along the way.

### #27: No one is perfect
My aunt used to say that there is a toilet in every house. Everyone has aspects that are not as good as you think. Every couple has some hard times, and every child has its own problems. Stop thinking that the grass is always greener on the other side of the fence, not even on this family that upload a story from Thailand just now.

### #28: You deserve it
A second after you’ll get promoted, at the moment you’re going into the stage, at the exact point that you’ll be in the top of your life- a little voice inside of you will wake up and say that you’re not that good and everyone is going to find out that you’re just an imposter. Shut it down and ignore, everyone is facing this impostor syndrome, you got here because of you, and you well deserved to be here.

### #29: No one cares that much about you
Not in a sense that if you’ll die no one will cry, but in the small things- if you use one word or another, how you dressed up, if there was a typo in this email you just sent or what you said in the middle of the conversation. You think everyone won’t ever forget the mistake that you did. Calm down- no one really paid attention.

### #30: Get bored
Getting bored is something people afraid of. Don’t be scared, deal with it. Feel comfortable with the boredom, welcome the void into your brain and let your mind wonder sporadically. You’re right- it’s much easier to run away and watch another stupid video on the internet instead of worrying about your student loan, but only when you are daydreaming you actually getting into the deepness of things.

---
That’s it for now until I’ll be 31, and hopefully will make enough mistakes to learn a new lesson.
