My talk from [DroidCon Tel-Aviv 2014](http://il.droidcon.com/2014/agenda/):

Shem will share development tips while explaining how things work under-the-hood. As part of his talk, he will demonstrate the right way of working with images, custom views, ListViews and Animations, with an emphasis of how to make your app feel slick and fast on all Android devices.
