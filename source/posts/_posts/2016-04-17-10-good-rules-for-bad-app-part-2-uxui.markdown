Welcome to my second part of the tutorial of how building a bad app. After we've building a bad app in the [first part](https://shem8.wordpress.com/2016/03/31/10-good-rules-for-bad-app-part-1-technical/), it's the time to call our designer to fuck it a bit more:
<!--more-->


## #1: Ignore material design guidelines


Google, one of the greatest companies in the world, put lots of efforts creating material design, they probably do a long user research and gather feedback from many expert, but hey- you are the one with the bachelor of industrial design, so you probably know better.


## #2: Invent your own navigation pattern


If Facebook can do it so can you, also- if your app will be so good Google might [give up](http://www.theverge.com/2016/3/15/11236152/material-design-update-bottom-navigation-bar) and adapt it.


## #3: Create a mysterious app icon


[caption id="attachment_1435" align="alignright" width="131"]![yo-app-icon](https://shem8.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/yo-app-icon.png) App that let you send "Yo", of course.[/caption]

That's really helpful when users need to quickly find your app from 40 apps icons grid.


## #4: Use your own ideas for icons


Now I'm talking about in app icons. I understand- you don't fully pleased with the Android default share icon, you're also didn't find anything suits to your needs between hundreds of [material design icons](https://design.google.com/icons/) so why not creating a full icon pack from your own?

**Bonus points: **don't even bother to add title to your menu items, so that users will able to get a textual hint.


## #5: Create intro, overlay explanations AND hints


Because users are stupid (mostly true) and they always read your explanation (no chance ever)

**Bonus points: **do a step-by-step tutorial with no option to skip.


## #6: Don't support integration with other apps within your app


[Android has a great mechanism](http://developer.android.com/training/basics/intents/index.html) to interact actions between apps, but that's not too good for your app because that means users are going to leave your app. When users leave your app, that means less cash from ads. Less cash means you MIGHT have to find a real job.


## #7: Don't support integration with other apps into your app


In addition to previous point- respect other apps and don't still they users please.

**Bonus points:** If you ended up supporting your app to filter intents from other apps- ignore context and just open the main screen and not the relevant page.


## #8: Put animations everywhere


A [splash screen animation](https://shem8.wordpress.com/2015/10/02/pimp-up-your-splash-screen/) is nice, even [Google](https://www.google.com/design/spec/animation/meaningful-transitions.html) recommend adding animation while moving between screens, and the more the merrier

## #9: Use gifs instead of drawing things in code or animation drawable


Yes, I know, [animation drawable](https://shem8.wordpress.com/2016/02/25/animated-vector-drawable/) might saves you a couple of MB, but your time is much more important!


## #10: Create resources for all resolutions


Because you just saves time, so lets waste it.
