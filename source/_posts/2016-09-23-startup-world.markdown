Fuck you startup scene with the 30 minute morning routine of reading TechCrunch, TNW, Wired, Gizmodo, Mashable, The Verge and PH. Fuck your weird startups and things like “Did you hear about the new Drones startup? it’s like Uber for birds”.
<!-- more -->

Fuck your crazy work hours, stop with the “Did you know that [Elon musk is working 100 hours a week](https://www.quora.com/Does-Elon-Musk-really-work-100-hours-a-week) and [Marissa Mayer pulling it to 130 with a baby in each hand](http://www.businessinsider.com/yahoo-ceo-marissa-mayer-on-130-hour-work-weeks-2016-8)?”. You’re not Elon Musk, you not going to get to space, you didn’t even leave US in the last 5 years. Just put your fucking Mac away and go play with your child.

Fuck with the [drinking problem you have](https://backchannel.com/do-startups-have-a-drinking-problem-920139d132a7#.8ymqt8b6n). Please stop celebrating every fucking imaginary milestone with whisky, beer, or pizza and beer. Fuck your eating disorders, why everything has to be so extreme? Half of your developers contains 70% pizza and live on office snacks. The other half [drop the chewing part and move to protein shakes](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/25/technology/in-busy-silicon-valley-protein-powder-is-in-demand.html), some even [give up food completely](http://www.businessinsider.com/nootrobox-employees-dont-eat-on-tuesdays-2016-7), WTF?!

And fuck with all those parties after raising money, don’t you get it? You just got deeper into the mud, you should celebrate any day that you haven’t sell another part of your company to someone.

Fuck your open space floor plans, do you really think Mark Zuckerberg can build an yearly plan while a [nerf war is going on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVKnF26qFFM)? Fuck you and your standing desk, [exercise ball desk](http://lifehacker.com/5830748/why-i-switched-my-office-chair-with-an-exercise-ball-and-what-it-feels-like), [laying desk](https://www.wired.com/2015/10/altwork-desk/), and [treadmill desk](http://www.businessinsider.com/the-truth-about-working-on-a-treadmill-desk-2013-11). Fuck you and all your coffee shops offices that you created.

Fuck with reading [a book a week](https://hbr.org/2016/02/how-to-read-a-book-a-week), no one can read that fast. How about actually *reading* that god damn book?! Fuck with all your references to Malcolm Gladwell and Dan Ariely, stop quoting Lean Startup, fuck all of you reading the same books. Fuck you tell me I must read “20 hours work week” after pulling an all nighter. Fuck you and your TO-READ list, I’m following on Goodreads, I know you won’t ever get there.

Fuck with all those straight out of college entrepreneur, just for you know- it’s called “unemployed”. Fuck your bootstrapping, fuck with working in a garage and fuck with your 2.5 square meters at WeWork. Fuck you- saving on an office but travel to NY once a week.

Fuck you productivity freaks. Making me feel bad because I woke up “only” at 6am. So you [woke up at 4:30](https://medium.com/life-hacks-for-business/12-lessons-of-waking-up-at-4-30-a-m-for-21-days-90d1053c3634#.bwqnvt9cg) and you already finished your meditate session and eating your healthy breakfast, so what. Fuck you working out 7 times a week + one yoga lesson at your office. Fuck you with your noise cancelling headphones and [Pomodoro timers](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/esington/esington-glass-the-ultimate-productivity-timer).

Fuck you telling me TV is a waste of time but keep Netflix and chill. Fuck all of you watching the same TV shows over and over. Keep laughing about how HBO make Silicon Valley so realistic instead of asking why. Fuck you keep telling me “[Always ask Why](http://www.inc.com/harvey-mackay/the-power-of-why.html)“. Fuck you and how’s Mr Robot is a bit like you. You’re just a robot, that’s different.

Fuck you and your stupid interview questions. I never had to shift a bit in a C array in my life, I never got a compilation error on a white board, when I need an hash set in Java I just use HashSet and I don’t care what the complexity of this code block because I can afford another EC2 instance!

Fuck you with all your jargon and acronyms that you all using. You try to explain my mother that you’re building a MVP to disrupt the e-commerce world and that your MAO looks good, but the current 7 day retention not going to be enough for a hockey stick.

Fuck you with all those transparency, the post mortem and the [5 whys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5_Whys). Fuck you with making a [Design sprint](http://www.gv.com/sprint/) every sprint, pushing to production 100 times a day, use no staging environment and fuck your micro services architecture. Fuck your feature flags and endless variants in your A/B testing. I want to get the same version of your site every time I refresh it, stop playing with my mind!

Fuck you startups with crazy off-sites events that costing so much money, you suppose to buy servers instead! Fuck you spending money on ping pong tables that no one ever going to use or [ridiculous rewards that you give](http://www.businessinsider.com/qihoo-360-awards-night-with-porn-star-julia-kyoka-to-employee-2015-2). Fuck your unlimited vacation policy, knowing that [your employees will take *less* time off](http://digiday.com/agencies/dark-side-unlimited-vacation-policies-agencies/).

**More than all, Fuck you startup world for making me one of you.**
